## Releases

This repo contains fixed and modified DDL and DML scripts to match SQLite syntax. Chapter-like `*.sql` scripts mostly created and tested in `sqliteman`. Some of them doesn't run in that application due to the new sql syntax which sqliteman does not support (window functions, chapter 9 script).

## TODO

12 chapter (common problems) ?
